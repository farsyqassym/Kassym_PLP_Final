*Interface normaly is a declation place not for implimentation (interface haina function)

*************
property binding = [disabled]="isDisabled" -kwenye property tumeweka true or false
class binding = HTML(class="text-danger")/ [class]="dangerClass" / [class.text-success]="successClass" / [ngClass]="objectName"
style binding = [style.color]="'orange'" / [style.color]="thiscolor ? 'red' : 'green'" -this is condition style (if true=red else=green)
